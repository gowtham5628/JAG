✅ PROGRAM DESCRIPTION (PROJECT READY)

This Python program is a Secure File Protection System designed to protect personal files using password authentication and security questions. It allows users to create a hidden folder that can be locked, unlocked, and accessed only by providing the correct password or answering backup security questions.

The system uses SHA-256 hashing to securely store passwords, ensuring that the original password is not saved in plain text. If the user forgets the password or fails to enter it correctly three times, they can still unlock the file using the security questions set during creation.

The program offers a simple text-based menu so users can easily choose different operations like creating a secure file, unlocking it, locking it again, or resetting the password. It also includes protection against unauthorized access by hiding folders using a dot-prefix and denying access after repeated failures.

📌 KEY FEATURES

1. Create a Secure File

User sets a filename, password, and two security question answers.

The file is hidden using a dot (.) prefix.

Password is stored using SHA-256 hashing.


2. Unlock File

User must enter the correct password.

Allowed 3 attempts.

If all attempts fail, the user can answer backup security questions.

If successful, the hidden folder becomes visible.


3. Lock File Again

Converts the visible folder back into a hidden one.


4. Reset Password

User enters the old password.

They can set a new password with confirmation.


5. Unauthorized Access Detection

If both password and security answers are wrong, the system denies access and keeps the file locked.
